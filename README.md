This project brings together many of my past efforts such as the unspendable.py command, and integration into various cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin, digibyte, and bitcoin.sv.

Some working examples are available at:

https://ledger.church 

This system requires:

mysql
digibyted
ipfs

It can also work with bitcoin.sv and dogecoind

It reads and writes messages into the public ledger using a fork of the 'unspendable.py' script which I 
have adapted to create an "unspendable language". It can be found at:

https://github.com/unspendable

Prominent examples of records created with this language include:

The last page of "Finnegans Wake" etched into Dogecoin:

A collection of Youtube Videos which are naturally indexed by any 3rd-party block explorer:

Through the https://ledger.church website, it is possible to view and create these records (if you have some crypto).

A sub-project also creates bitcoin.sv transactions which can contain images and is able to show images which other people
have loaded:
